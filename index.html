          However, I have not always work strictly as a web designer although I
          have been working on content design for many years, mostly related to
          education. This has given me a great insight in working with different
          people, for various audiences (public administrations, private,
          students, parents, teachers, adults, kids, you name it!). I have
          developed materials, newsletters and build up my skills in a more
          informal way, however I do have a great linguistic knowledge,
          bilingual fluency and social and cultural knowledge gather from my BA
          and MA.
          <br />I have a <strong>BA on English Studies</strong>, a
          <strong> MA on NorthAmerican studies</strong> with a focus on visual
          culture and communication an <strong>MA in education</strong>.
          <strong>UX Writing </strong>course from allWomen, UI design from
          allWomen, coding Bootcamp from SheCodes, where I earned my
          <strong>developer diploma</strong> <br />
          I am currently making my way into the AI World (which I think it would
          be a great thing to bring to MailerLite!) also thanks to the allWomen
          Bootcamp
          <strong>My technical set of skills;</strong> have been improving
          steady due to work, projects with clients and personal ones, over the
          last two years. As you will see in my portfolio I have applied all my
          prior knowledge to help develope great websites and apps.

          <br /><strong>Education</strong> is one of the most important things
          in my life and I am incontinuous learning and fine tuning my
          knowledge, either by taking courses on skills I have developed long
          ago (as you can see I am refreshing my UI knowledge with allWomen) or
          learning something completly knew and challengin like working with
          AI.<br />
          Also I consider that networking and talking with people from different
          backgrounds is a great way of getting our brains going and finding new
          fields of interests or new ways of expanding the skills that we
          already have!<br />I addition I love seeing people creating things, in
          YouTube and Forums and trying to learn from them, the world is full of
          ways of improving, we just have to make it out of our confort zone.
        </p>
        I look for <strong>inspiration</strong> in the challenging places. I
        mentioned in my video that accesibility is crucial for me and I love
        decoding a good challenge, how can I make what I love better, what is
        the piece missing?<br />I also look for inspiration in others, in what I
        love and in what I hate, everytime I find myself having a good
        experience or a bad experience related to the design of a wed or app I
        ask myself why? what bothers me? how am I or am I not represented here?

        <h3>My projects</h3>
        <p>
          I am working as a freelance developer at the moment and working right
          now in three projects for very three different clients. As metioned in
          my video Somatic Pilates is one of the projects i am working,
          developing the webpage from beginning to end. This project has
          presented some unique challenges in particular when the vision was not
          feasible from a design point of view. From the outset, we collaborated
          on a Figma board where we clearly outlined areas where we could
          experiment and get creative, and where we faced limitations. This open
          dialogue helped set realistic expectations while still leaving room
          for creative exploration. This client is working with a very uniquete
          color palette since she wants to convey both strength and sensibility
          to create a safe space within the website
          <br />

          By the time the prototype was done, it was already close to the final
          vision. I then developed the site using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap),
          and JavaScript, and initially hosted it on Netlify to give the client
          a chance to interact with the site before we moved it to their domain.
          I’m particularly proud of this project because it not only represented
          the client’s brand well but also aligned with a meaningful cause.
          Through patience and transparency, we were able to craft a space that
          was both visually engaging and functionally sound, resulting in a site
          that embodied the company’s values while being user-friendly and
          accessible.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have worked in a lot of projects for educational companies like
          Instrucko a company based in India that was teaching languages to
          children and teenages. My role there was to develope the content for
          the Spanish students from the visuals to the linguistics knowledge.
          The company has a very strick visual palette for each language and
          also visuals in general which did not allow a lot of creativity,
          however I had free range when it came to the individual activities for
          the students This role thought me to find ways to work on designs I
          believed while maintaining the brand look and what the client wanted.
          There is always a way to be creative.

                    This project build in Rectjs with Bootstrap has presented
                    different challenges, from accomodating the vision of the
                    client, from the impossibilities of some of the designs.
                    Collaboration and transparency have been keys and soon it

        <h3>My proficiency</h3>
        <p>
          In reards to coding: I am fully fluent in html5, CSS, bootstrap JS,
          React, Node.Js and TypeScript. I have worked with SEO oriented design
          and done the inBound course on Inbound Marketing with HubSpot. As you
          can see on this newsletter that I am personally coding I work with Git
          and host my code on GitHub when possible and I am using Bootstrap<br />I
          love working with Figma because it allows a lot of collaboration, they
          are constatly improving the platform and you can visualised the final
          products very clear before investing on the coding time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything that you might think I am lacking in skills I assure you I
          compensate with my enthusiasm and constant desire to learn and thrive.
        </p>
        <br />I believe in this day and time remote team collaboration is a
        must, in general remote work allows for more productivity, happier
        workers and happier clients.

        <h3>Good examples!</h3>
        <p>
          This might be controversial but I love slack, I think is a fantastic
          improvement when it comes to collaboration amount workers and
          communities, compared to other platforms outthere. It is dynamic, it
          allows for a lot of different environments, for files, links, it works
          great in a lot of platforms and I have worked with it before and
          always had great experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          MailerLite! The clean and minimalistic design makes it accesible, but
          elegant. The neutral pastel color makes it a calm enviroment and in
          general it is a great user experiance. As a bonus point the CTA
          buttons are a UX Writing work of art!
        </p>
        <p>
          Airtable is great as well, very different in terms of design from the
          previously two mentioned website, the colors are colder but it gives
          it a really spacious feel, the CAT are clear and direct and it has a
          lot of different resources that are easy to access.

        <h3>The spark</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading</strong> <br />You might have notice on the video that
          I was surrounded by books, it was not an strategie I am passionate
          about them, not only reading, but having them, their beauty, their
          smell, the aesthetics, everywhere I go I bring a book with me,
          everycountyr or city I buy books (this makes my travelling or moving
          form one country to another rather a challenge!)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nature</strong><br />I grew up in a very small village and
          from there moved to London and then to Madrid so my country girl heart
          tries to find every opportunity to connect with nature, from my house
          full of plants to any mountain adventure during the weekend!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Music and Podcasts</strong> <br />I study at a conservatory
          but it was not my professional call, however, music is a crucial part
          of my life, please enjoy this playlist that although generic is great
          for reading, hiking and the coming season!<iframe
