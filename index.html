        <h3>My skillset</h3>
        <p>
          Honesty is one of the most important qualities and as you will see by
          my resume, and my linkedIn I have not always work as a wed ddesigner
          although I have been working on content design for many years, mostly
          related to education. However, this has given me a great insight in
          working with different people, for various audiences (public
          administrations, private, students, parents, teachers, adults, kids,
          you name it!). I have developed materials, newsletters and build up my
          skills in a more informal way, however I do have a great linguistic
          knowledge, bilingual fluency and social and cultural knowledge gather
          from my BA and MA.
          <br />My official qualifications then are a BA on English Studies, a
          MA on NorthAmerican studies with a focus on visual culture and
          communication an MA in education. UX Writing course from allWomen, UI
          design from allWomen, coding Bootcamp from SheCodes and currently
          making my way into the AI World (which I think it would be a great
          thing to bring to MailerLite!) also thanks to the allWomen Bootcamp
          <strong>Regarding my technical set of skills;</strong> I have been
          working on them for two years and have certifications from two
          different schools allWomen based in Barcelona and SheCodes. As you
          will see in my portfolio I have applied all my prior knowledge to help
          develope great websites and apps. <br />Education is one of the most
          important things in my life and I am incontinuous learning and fine
          tuning my knowledge, either by taking courses on skills I have
          developed long ago (as you can see I am refreshing my UI knowledge
          with allWomen) or learning something completly knew and challengin
          like working with AI. Also I consider that networking and talking with
          people from different backgrounds is a great way of getting our brains
          going and finding new fields of interests or new ways of expanding the
          skills that we already have!<br />I addition I love seeing people
          creating things, in YouTube and Forums and trying to learn from them,
          the world is full of ways of improving, we just have to make it out of
          our confort zone.
        </p>
        I look for inspiration in the challenging places. I mentioned in my
        video that accesibility is crucial for me and I love decoding a good
        challenge, how can I make what I love better, what is the piece
        missing?<br />I also look for inspiration in others, in what I love and
        in what I hate, everytime I find myself having a good experience or a
        bad experience related to the design of a wed or app I ask myself why?
        what bothers me? how am I or am I not represented here?

        <h3>My projects</h3>
        <p>
          I am working as a freelance developer at the moment and working right
          now in three projects for very three different clients. 1. As metioned
          in my video Somatic Pilates is one of the projects i am working,
          developing the webpage from beginning to end. This project has
          presented some unique challenges in particular when the vision was not
          feasible from a design point of view. From the outset, we collaborated
          on a Figma board where we clearly outlined areas where we could
          experiment and get creative, and where we faced limitations. This open
          dialogue helped set realistic expectations while still leaving room
          for creative exploration. This client is working with a very uniquete
          color palette since she wants to convey both strength and sensibility
          to create a safe space within the website
          <br />
          I have worked in a lotof projects for educational companies like
          Instrucko a company based in India that was teaching languages to
          children and teenages. My role there was to develope the content for
          the Spanish students from the visuals to the linguistics knowledge.
          The company has a very strick visual palette for each language and
          also visuals in general which did not allow a lot of creativity,
          however I had free range when it came to the individual activities for
          the students This role thought me to find ways to work on designs I
          believed while maintaining the brand look and what the client wanted.
          There is always a way to be creative.
