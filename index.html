        <h3>My skillset üíª</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >I am fluent in HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, AI, JS (vanilla but also
            React Node.js and Typescript)</strong
          >
          I have not always worked strictly as a web designer although I have
          been working on content design for many years, mostly related to
          education. This experience has given me great insight and strengths
          when it come to working with different people and creating content for
          various clients (public administrations, private entities, students,
          parents, teachers, adults, kids- you name it!). I have developed
          materials, newsletters and build up my skills in a more informal way.
          However I also have a strong linguistic background and bilingual
          fluency in English and Spanish, thanks to my BA and MA.
          <br />I hold a <strong>BA on English Studies</strong>, an
          <strong> MA on North American studies</strong> with a focus on visual
          culture and communication, and an
          <strong>MA in Education</strong>.Additionally, I have completed a
          <strong>UX Writing </strong>course from allWomen, and a
          <strong>UI design </strong>from allWomen, as well as a coding Bootcamp
          from SheCodes, where I earned my <strong>Developer Diploma.</strong>
          <br />
          I am currently exploring the AI fiel, which I believe would be a great
          asset to bring to MailerLite. I am developing knowledge in AWS, data
          visualisation and creating models from beginning to end.
          <strong>My technical skill set</strong> has been steadily improving
          due to work, client projects, and personal ones, over the last two
          years. As you will see in my portfolio I have applied all my prior
          knowledge to help develop great websites and apps.

          <br /><strong>Education</strong> is one of the most important things
          in my life and I am continuously learning and fine-tuning my
          knowledge, either by taking courses on skills I developed long ago (as
          you can see I am refreshing my UI knowledge with allWomen) or by
          learning something completely new and challenging like working with
          AI.<br />
          However, learning does not always come from courses; networking and
          talking with people from different backgrounds is a great way to find
          new fields of interest or new ways of expanding the skills that we
          already have!<br />In addition, I love seeing people creating on
          YouTube and forums and trying to learn from them. The world is full of
          ways to improve; we just have to step out of our comfort zone.
        </p>
        <strong>Inspiration</strong> from me comes a lot from challenging
        places. I love decoding a good challenge, how can I make what I love
        better, what is the missing piece?<br />I also look for inspiration in
        others; in what I love and in what I dislike. Everytime I find myself
        having a good experience or a bad experience, I ask myself why? what
        bothers me? how am I or am I not represented here? and how would I make
        it better?
        <p>Let me give you some more information about me below!</p>

        <h3>My projects üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently working as a freelance developer and web designer. Some
          of the most incredible projects I am working on right now include
          developing the webpage for Somatic Pilates from beginning to end. This
          project has presented some unique challenges, particularly when the
          vision was not feasible from a design perspective. From the outset, we
          collaborated on a Figma board where we clearly outlined areas for
          experimentation and creativity, as well as identifying where we faced
          limitations. This open dialogue helped set realistic expectations
          while still allowing room for creative exploration. The client is
          working with a very unique color palette, as she wants to convey both
          strength and sensibility to create a safe space within the website.

          <br />

          By the time the prototype was completed, it was already close to the
          final vision. I then developed the site using HTML, CSS (with
          Bootstrap), and JavaScript, and initially hosted it on Netlify to give
          the client a chance to interact with the site before moving it to
          their domain. I am particularly proud of this project because it not
          only represented the client's brand well but also aligned with a
          meaningful cause. Through patience and transparency, we were able to
          craft a space that was both visually engaging and functionally sound,
          resulting in a site that embodied the company's values while being
          user-friendly and accessible.

          <br />
          <br />
          I have worked on many projects for educational companies, such as
          Instrucko, a company based in India that teaches languages to children
          and teenagers. My role there was to develop content for Spanish
          students, encompassing both visual elements and linguistic knowledge.
          The company has a very strict visual palette for each language, as
          well as for visuals in general, which did not allow for much
          creativity. However, I had more freedom when it came to designing
          individual activities for the students. This role taught me how to
          balance working on designs I believed in while maintaining the brand's
          look and meeting the client's needs. There is always a way to be
          creative.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some other projects (including educational, client, and
          personal projects). You will find almost everything on my portfolio,
          except for the deployment of projects that use the OpenAI API due to
          security reasons.

                    This project build in Reactjs with Bootstrap has presented
                    different challenges, from accomodating the vision of the
                    client, from the impossibilities of some of the designs.
                    Collaboration and transparency have been keys and soon it
                    will see the light. This is a project in collaboration with
                    workers from the University of West London.

            >HTML5, Vanilla CSS, Bootstrap, JS, React, Node.Js and TypeScript. I
            have worked with SEO oriented design and done the Inbound Marketing
            course with HubSpot.
          </strong>
          As you can see on this newsletter that I am coding I work with Git and
          Bootstrap and host my code on GitHub when possible.<br />I love
          working with <strong>Figma</strong> because it allows a lot of
          collaboration, they are constatly improving the platform and you can
          visualised the final products very clear before investing on the
          coding time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything that you might think I am lacking in skills I assure you I
          compensate with my
          <strong>enthusiasm and constant desire to learn and thrive.</strong>
        </p>
        <br />I believe in remote team collaboration since it allows for more
        productivity, happier workers and happier clients. I understand it has
        challenges and a lack of human contact, but the beauty of technology is
        that it help us overcome those challenges and find new ways to connect.

        <h3>Good examples!üòç</h3>
        <p>
          This might be controversial but <strong>I love Slack</strong>, I think
          is a fantastic improvement when it comes to collaboration amount
          workers and communities, compared to other platforms outthere. It is
          dynamic, it allows for a lot of different environments, for files,
          links, it works great in a lot of platforms and I have worked with it
          before and always had great experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MailerLite!</strong> The clean and minimalistic design makes
          it accesible, but elegant. The neutral pastel color makes it a calm
          enviroment and in general it is a great user experiance. As a bonus
          point the CTA buttons are a UX Writing work of art!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Airtable</strong> is great as well, very different in terms of
          design from the previously two mentioned website, the colors are
          colder but it gives it a really spacious feel, the CAT are clear and
          direct and it has a lot of different resources that are easy to
          access.

        <h3>The spark ü§©</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading</strong> <br />You might have notice on the video that
          I was surrounded by books, it was not an strategie I am passionate
          about them, not only reading, but having them, their beauty, their
          smell, the aesthetics, everywhere I go I bring a book with me,
          everycountyr or city I buy books (this makes my travelling or moving
          form one country to another rather a challenge!) in addition not
          always I do lite readings üòâ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nature</strong><br />I grew up in a very small village and
          from there moved to London and then to Madrid so my country girl heart
          tries to find every opportunity to connect with nature, from my house
          full of plants to any mountain adventure during the weekend!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Music and Podcasts</strong> <br />I study at a conservatory
          but it was not my professional call, however, music is a crucial part
          of my life, please enjoy this playlist that although generic is great
          for reading, hiking and the coming season!<iframe
