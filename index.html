        <h3>My skillset üíª</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >I am fluent in HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, AI, JS (vanilla but also
            React Node.js and Typescript)</strong
          >
          I have not always worked strictly as a web designer although I have
          been working on content design for many years, mostly related to
          education. This experience has given me great insight and strengths
          when it come to working with different people and creating content for
          various clients (public administrations, private entities, students,
          parents, teachers, adults, kids- you name it!). I have developed
          materials, newsletters and build up my skills in a more informal way.
          However I also have a strong linguistic background and bilingual
          fluency in English and Spanish, thanks to my BA and MA.
          <br />I hold a <strong>BA on English Studies</strong>, an
          <strong> MA on North American studies</strong> with a focus on visual
          culture and communication, and an
          <strong>MA in Education</strong>.Additionally, I have completed a
          <strong>UX Writing </strong>course from allWomen, and a
          <strong>UI design </strong>from allWomen, as well as a coding Bootcamp
          from SheCodes, where I earned my <strong>Developer Diploma.</strong>
          <br />
          I am currently exploring the AI fiel, which I believe would be a great
          asset to bring to MailerLite. I am developing knowledge in AWS, data
          visualisation and creating models from beginning to end.
          <strong>My technical skill set</strong> has been steadily improving
          due to work, client projects, and personal ones, over the last two
          years. As you will see in my portfolio I have applied all my prior
          knowledge to help develop great websites and apps.

          <br /><strong>Education</strong> is one of the most important things
          in my life and I am continuously learning and fine-tuning my
          knowledge, either by taking courses on skills I developed long ago (as
          you can see I am refreshing my UI knowledge with allWomen) or by
          learning something completely new and challenging like working with
          AI.<br />
          However, learning does not always come from courses; networking and
          talking with people from different backgrounds is a great way to find
          new fields of interest or new ways of expanding the skills that we
          already have!<br />In addition, I love seeing people creating on
          YouTube and forums and trying to learn from them. The world is full of
          ways to improve; we just have to step out of our comfort zone.
        </p>
        <strong>Inspiration</strong> for me comes a lot from challenging places.
        I love decoding a good challenge, how can I make what I love better,
        what is the missing piece?<br />I also look for inspiration in others;
        in what I love and in what I dislike. Everytime I find myself having a
        good experience or a bad experience, I ask myself why? what bothers me?
        how am I or am I not represented here? and how would I make it better?
        <p>Let me give you some more information about me below!</p>

        <h3>My projects üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently working as a freelance developer and web designer. Some
          of the most incredible projects I am working on right now include
          developing the webpage for Somatic Pilates from beginning to end. This
          project has presented some unique challenges, particularly when the
          vision was not feasible from a design perspective. From the outset, we
          collaborated on a Figma board where we clearly outlined areas for
          experimentation and creativity, as well as identifying where we faced
          limitations. This open dialogue helped set realistic expectations
          while still allowing room for creative exploration. The client is
          working with a very unique color palette, as she wants to convey both
          strength and sensibility to create a safe space within the website.

          <br />

          By the time the prototype was completed, it was already close to the
          final vision. I then developed the site using HTML, CSS (with
          Bootstrap), and JavaScript, and initially hosted it on Netlify to give
          the client a chance to interact with the site before moving it to
          their domain. I am particularly proud of this project because it not
          only represented the client's brand well but also aligned with a
          meaningful cause. Through patience and transparency, we were able to
          craft a space that was both visually engaging and functionally sound,
          resulting in a site that embodied the company's values while being
          user-friendly and accessible.

          <br />
          <br />
          I have worked on many projects for educational companies, such as
          Instrucko, a company based in India that teaches languages to children
          and teenagers. My role there was to develop content for Spanish
          students, encompassing both visual elements and linguistic knowledge.
          The company has a very strict visual palette for each language, as
          well as for visuals in general, which did not allow for much
          creativity. However, I had more freedom when it came to designing
          individual activities for the students. This role taught me how to
          balance working on designs I believed in while maintaining the brand's
          look and meeting the client's needs. There is always a way to be
          creative.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some other projects (including educational, client, and
          personal projects). You will find almost everything on my portfolio,
          except for the deployment of projects that use the OpenAI API due to
          security reasons.

                    This project, built in React.js with Bootstrap, has

          I am fully fluent in
          <strong
            >HTML5, vanilla CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and
            TypeScript. I have experience with SEO-oriented design and have
            completed the Inbound Marketing course with HubSpot.
          </strong>
          As you can see from this newsletter that I am coding, I work with Git
          and Bootstrap and host my code on GitHub when possible.<br />I love
          working with <strong>Figma</strong> because it facilitates
          collaboration. The platform is constantly improving, and you can
          visualize the final product very clearly before investing coding time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is any skill you think I might be lacking, I assure you that
          I compensate with my
          <strong>enthusiasm and constant desire to learn and thrive.</strong>
        </p>
        <br />I believe in remote team collaboration because it enhances
        productivity, leads to happier workers, and results in more satisfied
        clients. I understand that it comes with challenges and a lack of
        face-to-face interaction, but the beauty of technology is that it helps
        us overcome these challenges and discover new ways to connect.

        <h3>Good examples!üòç</h3>
        <p>
          This might be controversial, but <strong>I love Slack</strong>. I
          believe it is a fantastic tool for collaboration among workers and
          communities, compared to other platforms out there. It is dynamic,
          supports a variety of environments, handles files and links
          efficiently, and works well across many platforms. I have used it
          before and have always had great experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MailerLite!</strong> The clean and minimalistic design makes
          it accessible yet elegant. The neutral pastel colors create a calm
          environment, and overall, it provides a great user experience. As a
          bonus, the CTA buttons are a work of art in UX writing!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Airtable</strong> is great as well. It is very different in
          terms of design from the previously mentioned websites; the colors are
          cooler, which gives it a spacious feel. The CTAs are clear and direct,
          and the platform offers a variety of resources that are easy to
          access.

        <h3>The spark ü§©</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading</strong> <br />You might have noticed in the video
          that I was surrounded by books. This was not a strategy; I am truly
          passionate about them‚Äînot just reading, but also owning them. I
          appreciate their beauty, their smell, and their aesthetics. Wherever I
          go, I bring a book with me, and in every country or city I visit, I
          buy more books. This passion can make traveling or moving from one
          country to another quite a challenge! in addition not always I do lite
          readings üòâ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nature</strong><br />I grew up in a very small village and
          later moved to London and then to Madrid. My country girl heart seeks
          every opportunity to connect with nature, from having a house full of
          plants to embarking on mountain adventures during the weekends!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Music and Podcasts</strong><br />I studied at a conservatory,
          but it wasn‚Äôt my professional path. However, music remains a crucial
          part of my life. Please enjoy this playlist, which, although generic,
          is great for reading, hiking, and the upcoming season!
